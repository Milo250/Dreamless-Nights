<p>Struggling to get some restful sleep these days? Feeling the exhaustion from burning the midnight oil on your studies? This resource is exactly what you need!</p>
<p>Stick to a Sleep Schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Consistency is key.
<br>Create a Restful Environment: Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Consider using earplugs or an eye mask if needed.
<br> Limit Screen Time Before Bed: The blue light from screens can interfere with your sleep. Try to avoid screens at least an hour before bedtime.
<br> Mind Your Diet: Avoid heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime. Opt for a light snack if you're hungry.
<br>Be Active During the Day: Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. Just don't exercise too close to bedtime.
<br>Relax and Wind Down: Develop a relaxing bedtime routine. This could be reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing deep breathing exercises.
<br>Watch Out for Naps: While naps can be beneficial, long or irregular napping during the day can negatively affect your sleep. Keep naps short and earlier in the day.
<br>Manage Stress: Try to resolve your worries or stress before bedtime. Writing down your thoughts or practicing mindfulness can help clear your mind.</p>
