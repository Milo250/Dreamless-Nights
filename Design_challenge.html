<h2>Struggling to get some restful sleep these days? Feeling the exhaustion from burning the midnight oil on your studies? This resource is exactly what you need!
<br><b>Stick to a Sleep Schedule:</b> Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Consistency is key.
<br><b>Create a Restful Environment:</b> Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Consider using earplugs or an eye mask if needed.
<br><b>Limit Screen Time Before Bed:</b> The blue light from screens can interfere with your sleep. Try to avoid screens at least an hour before bedtime.
<br><b>Mind Your Diet:</b> Avoid heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime. Opt for a light snack if you're hungry.

<br><b>Be Active During the Day:</b> Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. Just don't exercise too close to bedtime.
<br><b>Relax and Wind Down:</b> Develop a relaxing bedtime routine. This could be reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing deep breathing exercises.
<br><b>Watch Out for Naps:</b> While naps can be beneficial, long or irregular napping during the day can negatively affect your sleep. Keep naps short and earlier in the day.
<br><b>Manage Stress:</b> Try to resolve your worries or stress before bedtime. Writing down your thoughts or practicing mindfulness can help clear your mind.
